# Hyperfocus

Master your flow. A dedicated productivity tool for entrepreneurs, freelancers, and creators, combining Deep Work principles with the Pomodoro technique.

## What is Hyperfocus?

Hyperfocus helps you structure your day, protect your focus time, and execute on what actually moves the needle.  
It is designed for ambitious solo founders and small teams who want less chaos and more consistent output.

## Core features (current & planned)

- Focus sessions inspired by Pomodoro and Deep Work.
- Simple task management with priorities.
- Daily view so you always know what to work on next.
- Support for routines and recurring tasks.
- Multilingual experience (EN/FR) for international users.

## Tech stack

- Frontend: React + TypeScript (Vite).
- Styling: [compléter si tu utilises Tailwind/Chakra/etc.].
- AI: Gemini API (via Google AI Studio / Antigravity for initial scaffolding).
- Deployment: Netlify (via `netlify.toml`).
